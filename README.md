# BSMSNotes

This is a Github repository made by me. It contains the notes of some of the courses taken by my during my semester at IISER Pune.

I have randomly decided to them publish it on GitHub.

The files will ideally be updated by the end of the class.
Worst case by the end of the day.
Also. I am a human and may or may not continue this forever
